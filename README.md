# Task Board

## Description

I created a taskboard with desire to have a site that can organize my tasks that I add to the board. I built it because I wanted a site that not only addes task to a list but has the functionality to color code those tasks based on their deadlines, as well as being able to drag them to different columns as I complete each task. It solves the issue of not being able to keep track of the things i need to get done during the week. Because of this project I learned how to better utilize Jquery.
